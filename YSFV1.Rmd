```{r setup, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This homework contains some data adapted from Mamerow and colleagues (2016), article to be found here:[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27684105/]. 

The study looks at risk-taking across the age span amongst 902 people aged 18-90, and looks at risk-taking in 2 different ways.

The self.csv file contains a self-reported risk taking measure, as well as background variables. Variables comprise:

* partid: participant id
* sex: (0=male, 1=female)
* age: age in years
* riskSR: self reported risk attitude  (0-10)

The gambles.csv file contains experimental data for the same participants when they performed a gambling simulation. On each trial the participant makes a forced choice decision between 2 investments, each with a specific pay-off and specific chance of success. Each time there is a risky and a safe choice, differing in profile. Any money earned is kept by the participant to incentivise them to choose realistically.

Each person did 8 trials, split into 4 'normal' and 4 'higher risk' trials, where taking the risky option would lead to a loss in the long run. The variables are:

* partid: participant id
* scenario: scenario of the gamble (there were 8 scenarios, each person saw each scenario once)
* trialtype: 0 = normal trial, 1 = higher risk trial
* RiskyChoice: 0 = safe choice chosen, 1 = risky choice chosen

First load the data and any libraries you will need.
```{r purl=FALSE}
self <- read.csv('self.csv') 

gambles <- read.csv('gambles3.csv') 
library(tidyverse)
library(lmerTest)

```


Q1. We want to predict if self reported risk attitude is associated with age. What type of model do we need for this? What is the DV? Are there any random effects?
```{r q01}
# DV: self-reported risk attitude
# Random effects: -
# Model needed: polynomial regression
```

Q2. First we will centre and scale the age variable in the `self` dataframe and call it `age_cs` Note: this is what they did in the original study (unlike previous times when we have merely centrered it).
```{r q02}
self <- self %>% mutate(age_cs=scale(age) %>% as.numeric())
```


Q3. Plot the data showing how age predicts self reported risk taking, with a different regression line for each sex

HINT: what data type does sex need to be for this to work?
```{r q03}
Q3 <- self  %>% mutate(sex=recode(as.character(sex),"0"="Male",
                                  "1"="Female"))


ggplot(Q3, aes(x=age_cs, y=riskSR, color=sex)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", aes(fill= sex)) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

Q4. Find out for yourself: Try to improve the layout of the plot so that the legend informs us which line is which. HINT the layer starts with `scale_` and contains the aes mapping and the data type.

```{r q04}
ggplot(Q3, aes(x=age_cs, y=riskSR, color=sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.2) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", aes(fill= sex), se=F) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c('#E69F00','#56B4E9'))+
  theme(legend.position="top") +
  scale_color_manual(labels=c("Female", "Male"), values=c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9")) + 
  labs(x="Age Centered", y="Self Reported Risk")
```

Q5. What does the graph suggest about risk attitudes
```{r q05}
# Male participants start with a slightly higher self reported risk compared to females at age centered = -2, but converge at age centered = 2. Females self reported risk seem to remain constant. Overall, the graph suggests that risk attitudes remain constant (i.e., age is a non-significant predictor).  
```


Q6. This code is to run the model with age_cs as a predictor and call it mod1. In the paper they included linear, quadratic and cubic effects of age.
Can you fix the code so that it runs?
```{r q06}
mod1 <- lm(riskSR ~ age_cs + I(age_cs^2) + I(age_cs^3), data=self)
summary(mod1)
```

Q7. Does adding an effect of sex improve the model - call this `mod2`? 
```{r q07}
#mod2
mod2 <- lm(riskSR ~ age_cs + I(age_cs^2) + I(age_cs^3) + sex, data=self)
summary(mod2)

#comparing models 
anova(mod1, mod2)
# mod2 which included sex is a better model as it explains significantly more variance (p<.001) compared to mod1. 

tab_model(mod1, mod2)
```


Q8. Now lets combine the self and gambles data and call this `combi`
```{r q08}
combi <- inner_join(self, gambles, by="partid")
```

Q9. Overall, on what proportion of trials did people made the riskier choice under the 'normal' and 'high risk' conditions
```{r q09}
combi %>% group_by(trialtype) %>% summarise(mean_RiskyChoice=mean(RiskyChoice),
          sd_RiskyChoice=sd(RiskyChoice))

# People under normal condition made 47.98% risky choices.
# People under high-risk condition made 38.69% risky choices.
```

Q10. How do you interpret this in words?
```{r q10}
# Overall, people in the safe condition tended to make riskier choices (proportion of risk = 47.98%) compared to the high risk condition (proportion of risk = 38.89%). However, the sd is high in both conditions, which indicates that there was a lot of variability within them. 
```

Q11. We want to model RiskyChoice as the dependent variable, with trialtype and age as predictors. What random effects should we consider?
```{r q11}
# participant (partid) and scenario
```


Q12. Build a model with a fixed effect of trial type - include random intercepts and slopes for participant and random intercepts for scenarios and call it `mod4`. 

```{r q12}
mod4 <- lmer(RiskyChoice ~ trialtype + (1+trialtype|partid) + (1|scenario), data=combi)
summary(mod4)
tab_model(mod4)
```

Q13. The final question involves using Rstudio to push a file to GitHub.
